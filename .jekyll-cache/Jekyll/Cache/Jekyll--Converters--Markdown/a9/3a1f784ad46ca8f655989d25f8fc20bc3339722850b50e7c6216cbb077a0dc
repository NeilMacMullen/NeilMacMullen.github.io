I"ù<p>If you spend much time in the terminal, you probably hit the TAB key with depressing regularity as you gently coax the shell into figuring out which folder youâ€™re trying to get to.</p>

<p>If you work in PowerShell <em>and</em> WSL (or DOS - does anyone really still do this?) then you have the added problem of trying to remember how to map WSL folders to Windows paths and vice-versa.</p>

<p><strong>Jumpfs</strong> is a simple cross-platform exe and set of scripts that take away some of the pain from the average developers day.  You can easily:</p>
<ul>
  <li>bookmark folders or files - even lines within a file!</li>
  <li>go straight to those bookmarks regardless of which shell youâ€™re in</li>
  <li>open a bookmarked location in VS Code or your favourite editor</li>
  <li>open a bookmarked folder in Windows Explorer - even if youâ€™re in WSL</li>
  <li>use a bookmark as an element in a shell command</li>
</ul>

<p>Itâ€™s easier to show than describe so hereâ€™s what it looks like in action:</p>
